## Features

- **Range Query:** Efficiently retrieve all elements within a specified range.
- **Best First Search:** Implement best-first search to find optimal solutions in the B-tree.
- **B-tree Implementation:** Custom B-tree implementation tailored for these algorithms.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Includes various optimizations to improve search performance.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pkourr/Range-query-and-Best-First-on-Btree.git
cd Range-query-and-Best-First-on-Btree
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the implemented algorithms in your project:

```python
from btree import BTree
from queries import range_query, best_first_search

# Initialize a B-tree
btree = BTree(order=4)

# Insert elements into the B-tree
elements = [20, 10, 30, 50, 40, 60, 70, 80]
for elem in elements:
    btree.insert(elem)

# Perform a range query
result = range_query(btree, 30, 70)
print("Range Query Result:", result)

# Perform a best-first search
result = best_first_search(btree, 60)
print("Best First Search Result:", result)
```

## Examples

### Range Query Example

```python
# Range query to find all elements between 30 and 70
result = range_query(btree, 30, 70)
print("Range Query Result:", result)
```

### Best First Search Example

```python
# Best first search to find the optimal element closest to 60
result = best_first_search(btree, 60)
print("Best First Search Result:", result)
```
